# LiveLesson-wide Shared Directory and Web Editor

- Create a single shared scratch directory
- Lesson authors can pre-populate scratch directory by placing files in a `scratch` directory within
  the lesson dir in Github - Antidote will copy these into the live scratch dir. This replaces the existing model where Antidote-y files are mixed with lesson examples and scripts.
- Optional support for an editor tab that has R/W access to this directory (boolean var in the lesson meta)
